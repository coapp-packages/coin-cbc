***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Cbc package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the 'trunk' (where the
   development happens) version of the code into a subdirectory
   named "Cbc", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cbc/trunk Cbc

   To download stable/2.0 you'd type:


   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Cbc/stable/2.0 Cbc


   etc.

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc 
   and extract it. For example, for the release 2.0.0 you type

   gunzip Cbc-2.0.0.tgz
   tar xvf Cbc-2.0.0.tar

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
Cbc or Cbc-2.0.0).  Then create a build directory and
configure the package by typing

   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Cbc Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Cbc successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   Cbc/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at
